REST interface to Probix core
------------------------------

Currently there are two main entities implemented:
object, probe.

Object - is a representation of monitoring object,
parameter that is monitored.
Probe - is a single measurement value for a specific Object.

All data should be represented in JSON format for interaction.

Following REST interface should be used to access data:

| Method  | URL                    |  Request data | Response data |
--------------------------------------------------------------------
| GET     | /objects               |  []           | [ object ]    |
| GET     | /object/Id             |  []           | object        |
| PUT     | /object/Id             | object        | object        |
| POST    | /object                | object        | object        |
| DELETE  | /object/Id             |  []           | ????          |
| GET     | /object/Id/probes      |  []           | [ probe ]     |
| GET     | /object/Id/probes?Args |  []           | [ probe ]     |
| GET     | /object/Id/probe/Id    |  []           | probe         |
| POST    | /object/Id/probe       | probe         | probe         |
| POST    | /object/Id/probe       | [ probe ]     | [ probe ]     |
| DELETE  | /object/Id/probe/Id    |  []           | ????          |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

object:
  { id: Integer,
    name: String,
	info: String
  }
[ object ]:
    array of objects
	
probe:
   { id: Integer,
     id_object: Integer,
	 timestamp: Timestamp,
	 value: Value
   }
[ probe ]:
     array of probes
	 
Args:
	from=Timestamp1&to=Timestamp2

Notes:
1) We have to provide interface for creating a number of probes for Object
from JSON Array
2) Result of operation is reflected in HTTP code: 400 Bad request, 201 Created, 304 Not Modified, 200 Ok, 404 Not found, 409 Conflict, 501 Not implemented

Questions:
1) What should be result for DELETE operation
