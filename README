REST interface to Probix core
------------------------------

Currently there are two main entities implemented: object, probe.

Object - is a representation of monitoring object, parameter that is monitored.
Probe - is a single measurement value for a specific Object.

All data should be represented in JSON format for interaction.

Following REST interface should be used to access data:

| Method  | URL                    |  Request data | Response data |
--------------------------------------------------------------------
| GET     | /objects               | none          | [ object ]    |
| GET     | /object/Id             | none          | object        |
| PUT     | /object/Id             | object        | object        |
| POST    | /object                | object        | object        |
| DELETE  | /object/Id             | none          | none          |
| GET     | /object/Id/probes      | none          | [ probe ]     |
| GET     | /object/Id/probes?Args | none          | [ probe ]     |
| GET     | /object/Id/probe/Id    | none          | probe         |
| POST    | /object/Id/probe       | probe         | probe         |
| POST    | /object/Id/probe       | [ probe ]     | [ probe ]     |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.
Here's what's going on with our various status codes:

200 OK: everything went awesome.
400 Bad Request: your request is invalid, and we'll return an error message that tells you why.
401 Not Authorized: either you need to provide authentication credentials, or the credentials provided aren't valid.
403 Forbidden: we understand your request, but are refusing to fulfill it. An accompanying error message should explain why.
404 Not Found: either you're requesting an invalid URI or the resource in question doesn't exist (ex: no such object).
500 Internal Server Error: we did something wrong.

Error message format:

error: {
	request: String,
	error: String
}
